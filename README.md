http://www.codeconcept.pl/zadanie

For a properly work of application it's need to update existing "daneWejsciowe.json" with a structure shown in excercise description.

Application has no GUI interface. It's need to be called via IDE enviroment by execution Main.java class.
For JSON retrieving/saving application uses jackson-databind library in 2.9.8 version.

After program execution results are available in "daneWyjsciowe.json". 
It's suggested to use online JSON parser for a better output view for example: https://jsonformatter.org/json-parser
